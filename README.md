# Advance Programming Proyect1_Bonilla_Roberto

# First Proyect of Advance programming

The first time that i came to work in this proyect i didn't know what to do because i was a little lost.

For this one i create a tic tac toe game. with the colors of los angeles lakers and the name of two players.
Lebron James "king james"
Anthony davis "The brow"

Hopes enjoy the game.
